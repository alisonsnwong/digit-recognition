# Digit Recognition with SVD and Centroid Classification Algorithm

This project aims to investigate and evaluate two distinct classification algorithms: a centroid classification algorithm and a more sophisticated and accurate approach utilizing singular value decomposition (SVD) on handwritten digits derived from the U.S. Postal Service database.
